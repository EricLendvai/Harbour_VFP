# Harbour_VFP
Partial Compatibly For VFP 9 in Harbour
This is a work in progress and will focus on adding support for PRGs functions and commands.

Many features in Harbour are driven by the fact that Harbour is not only a compiler but has a very powerful a pre-compiler.

There are many similarities between VFP and Harbour, but in some area, like arrays, Harbour has more flexibility and power than VFP.

On the other hand, VFP is a superior for Graphical User Interface features, including visual inheritance for forms and classes, but only in Windows 32-bits apps.

The Examples folder currently only has one example: hb_vfp_Test.code-workspace (open with VSCODE)
